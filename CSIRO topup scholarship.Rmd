# Cover letter

I would like to express my interest in the CSIRO postgraduate Top-Up scholarship Land and Water. I am a first year PhD candidate at the University of New England, Armidale, under the supervision of Dr. Romina Rader (UNE, Australia) and Dr. Ignasi Bartomeus (EBD, Spain). The aim of this application is to collaborate with two great experts on Conservation Biology that is my main research topic and therefore be able to use CSIRO resources to improve the quality of my research. 

Currently, my research is focused on the understanding of plant coexistence through interactions with another trophic level, pollinators. Plant species can have competitive or facilitative interactions, when competition occurs, it can take place in several ways. Species can compete through pollen interactions and depending on species traits the outcome of these interactions will differ. In my research we are trying to understand what traits modulate these interactions and their implications at community level.  Therefore, my research interest fits with the section 3 of the Research Area of Land and Water application form; “Predicting local biodiversity extinction rates in intensifying production landscapes”.

The understanding of species composition and what are the factors that modulates it has been always an intriguing question to me and this scholarship gives me the chance to get involved in an exciting project where I can put in practise all the acquired knowledge about Conservation Biology. Moreover, I have done a Masters Degree of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology at Pablo de Olavide University (Seville, Spain) graduating with First Class Honours where I was involved in a research project about species coexistence in the National Park of Donana (Huelva, Spain) with a computational approach which links with the main topic of the Research Area I’m applying for. The paper written of this project was submitted to Ecology Letters and currently we are working on Referees’ reports on the manuscript to resubmit to the journal.

The type of PhD that I’m doing is by publications, which means that each chapter that I’m developing would be equal to a manuscript. The first chapter involves glasshouse experiments with distinct pollination treatments within 4 different families of Eudicots (Brassicaceae, Convolvulaceae, Lamiaceae and Solanaceae). The second chapter or manuscript is adding a next level of complexity that is to include three taxa of pollinators to this glasshouse experiments once we know how the distinct plants behave with the pollination treatments. The third paper is a meta-analysis of the importance of the distinct plant and pollinator traits that are involved in the effect of heterospecific pollen. Lastly, the fourth chapter is a broad picture at community-ecosystem level where we are trying to understand what processes modulate species coexistence. In my opinion, the topic of the scholarship fits completely with this broad perspective because of the scale and my personal interests.

In order to show the skills that I have with R, I have done all this document on Markdown. This means that I'm able to develop research in an open source and share codes with my collaborators through git which allows a fast and productive interaction to develop research of the highest quality possible. My possible future collaborators of the CSIRO have a strong knowledegde of computational biology and my ability to also use different programming languages such as Markdown and HTML can improve our possible collaborations. Furthermore, I already have experience of planning experiments, writting a manuscript and submitting which gives me the necessary skills to overcome the difficult publishing process.

My longer term career aspirations are to keep involved in research as a postdoctoral researcher after I finish my PhD in a lab where they study biodiversity and conservation. Moreover, I have been always attracted by the idea of being a proffesor and try to help people in the understanding of ecology. Although they are ambitious objectives I strongly believe that if have succesful PhD with the expected publications I could keep myself in the competitive world of research.
